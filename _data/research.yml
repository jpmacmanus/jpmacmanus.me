      Given any countable group \(G\), we construct uncountably many quasi-isometry
      classes of proper geodesic metric spaces with quasi-isometry group isomorphic
      to \(G\). Moreover, if the group \(G\) is a hyperbolic group, the spaces we
      construct are hyperbolic metric spaces. 
      
      We make use of a rigidity phenomenon
      for quasi-isometries exhibited by many symmetric spaces, called strong
      quasi-isometric rigidity. Our method involves the construction of new
      examples of strongly quasi-isometrically rigid spaces, arising as graphs of
      strongly quasi-isometrically rigid rank-one symmetric spaces.

      Suppose that \(X\) is an infinite, connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph 
      with the property that every bi-infinite quasi-geodesic uniformly coarsely separates 
      \(X\) into exactly two deep pieces. We show that such an \(X\) is quasi-isometric to either the 
      Euclidean plane or the hyperbolic plane. In particular, if \(X\) is a Cayley graph of a 
      finitely generated group \(G\) with the above property, then \(G\) is a virtual surface group. 
      This can be interpreted as an extension of the well-known fact that a hyperbolic group 
      with circular boundary is virtually Fuchsian. 
    
      Our theorem positively resolves Problem 14.98 of the Kourovka Notebook, posed by 
      V. A. Churkin in 1999.  
      The proof uses an isoperimetric inequality of Varopoulos to show that if 
      such a graph has the above property, then either it is hyperbolic or has quadratic growth.

      Given a connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph \(X\) which is quasi-isometric to 
      a planar graph \(\Gamma\), we remark that one can upgrade \(\Gamma\) to be a planar Cayley graph, 
      answering a question raised by Esperet--Giocanti and Hamann.

    abstract: |
      We study a generalization of the well-known disjoint paths problem which we call the metric Menger problem, 
      denoted \(MM(r,k)\), where one is given two subsets of a graph and must decide whether they can be connected 
      by \(k\) paths of pairwise distance at least \(r\). 
      We prove that this problem is \(NP\)-complete for every \(r\geq 3\) and \(k\geq 2\) by giving a reduction from \(3SAT\). 
      This resolves a conjecture recently stated by Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu.

      We prove that acylindrically hyperbolic groups are monotileable. That is, every finite subset of the group is 
      contained in a finite tile. This provides many new examples of monotileable groups, and progress 
      on the question of whether every countable group is monotileable. In particular, 
      one-relator groups and many Artin groups are monotileable.

      We prove that a connected, locally finite, quasi-transitive graph which is 
      quasi-isometric to a planar graph is necessarily accessible. 
      This leads to a complete classification of the finitely generated groups which 
      are quasi-isometric to planar graphs. In particular, such a group is virtually a free product of free 
      and surface groups, and thus virtually admits a planar Cayley graph.

      We show that a finitely presented group virtually admits a planar Cayley graph 
      if and only if it is asymptotically minor-excluded, partially 
      answering a conjecture of Georgakopoulos and Papasoglu in the affirmative.

    abstract: |
      We present an algorithm which decides whether a given quasiconvex residually finite subgroup \(H\) of a 
      hyperbolic group \(G\) is associated with a splitting. The methods developed also provide algorithms for 
      computing the number of filtered ends \(\tilde e(G,H)\) of \(H\) in \(G\) under certain hypotheses, and 
      give a new straightforward algorithm for computing the number of ends \(e(G,H)\) of the Schreier graph of \(H\). 
      Our techniques extend those of Barrett via the use of labelled digraphs, 
      the languages of which encode information on the connectivity of \(\partial G - \Lambda H\).

      We give quantum speedups of several general-purpose numerical optimisation methods for
      minimising a function \(f : \mathbb{R}^n \to \mathbb{R}\). First, we show that many techniques for global optimisation
      under a Lipschitz constraint can be accelerated near-quadratically. Second, we show that
      backtracking line search, an ingredient in quasi-Newton optimisation algorithms, can be
      accelerated up to quadratically. Third, we show that a component of the Nelder-Mead algorithm
      can be accelerated by up to a multiplicative factor of \(O(\sqrt{n})\text{.}\) Fourth, we show that a quantum
      gradient computation algorithm of Gilyén et al can be used to approximately compute gradients in
      the framework of stochastic gradient descent. In each case, our results are based on applying
      existing quantum algorithms to accelerate specific components of the classical algorithms, rather
      than developing new quantum techniques.
