<h3>Research fellow at the Univerity of Bristol</h3>


<p id="bio">
I am a research fellow in mathematics at the University of Bristol, having recently completed my PhD at the University of Oxford, supervised by <a href="https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/people/panagiotis.papazoglou">Panos Papazoglou</a>. 
</p>

<p id="bio">
My PhD was funded by a scholarship from the
<a href="https://heilbronn.ac.uk/">Heilbronn Institute for Mathematical Research</a>, as well as a Graduate Development 
Scholarship from <a href="https://www.st-annes.ox.ac.uk/">St Anne's College, Oxford</a>. 
</p>

<p id="bio">
I previously completed the MFoCS MSc at Oxford, funded by a grant from <a href="https://www.jamespantyfedwen.cymru/">the James Pantyfedwen Foundation</a>. 
Before this, I was an undergraduate student at the University of Bristol,
where I earned a BSc in Mathematics and Computer Science.
</p>

<p id="bio">
I am broadly interested in geometric group theory, particularly questions relating to splittings, coarse geometry, 
and algorithmic problems.
